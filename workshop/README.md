# Welcome!

Hosted by the CMU Statistics & Data Science Department, the Carnegie Mellon University 
Football Analytics Workshop is an interactive workshop focusing on data exploration skills with 
football data!

The starter code scripts for working with `nflscrapR` are located in the 
[code folder](https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data/blob/master/workshop/code).
We will start with the `init_pit_cin_data_STARTER.R` file for the first half,
then will move on to the `analyze_season_data_STARTER.R` in the second half.
